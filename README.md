# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by looking at the core of what they are asking for and decide how they can best fit into the project. Creating user stories helps me keep track of and interpret these needs by splitting them up into diguestible subjects and keeping them in one place. User stories is a very convient way to store and manage user requests. It makes them simple and ordered and makes it easy to make sure complete all of the ones you need to complete, while leaving options for if you have extra time.
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I used to not really plan out my projects, simply diving into the aspect I thought would be easiest. Breaking down the requirements of a project and the difficulty will help me with time management. If I work woth a larger group, many of the communication and organization processes will be helpful. 
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means doing you job and going above and beyond to help your team members. Properly communicating with the team is crucial, without communication, the project would be totally incomplete. Listening to your coworkers and doing your work properly are the best ways to ensure that your team works well and you make the best product possible.
